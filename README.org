* Rip Discs

A few scripts to make ripping your media easier (for personal backup purposes).

** rip-movie

** rip-episodes

** find-movie

Takes a movie name as its first argument and returns the correct title and year of its
release. Queries the [[https://www.themoviedb.org/][TMDb API]] using [[https://github.com/celiao/tmdbsimple/][tmdbsimple]], so install that first:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install tmdbsimple
#+END_SRC

Register for an API key with TMDb, and put it in the file =~/.tmdb_api_key=.

Run the script by passing the movie name as the first argument:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
❯ python find-movie TOP_GUN
Top Gun (1986)
#+END_SRC


If a movie can't be found, it'll return error code 1 and report it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
❯ python find-movie AAAAA
find-movie: movie not found
#+END_SRC


The movie returned will be the most popular one found that matches the string passed, and
unicode characters will be replaced to allow for filesystem compatibility:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
❯ python find-movie 'the italian job'
The Italian Job (2003)

❯ python find-movie amelie
Am?lie (2001)
#+END_SRC
